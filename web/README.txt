Things i did in the final assignment

- I ensured that the web ui would work in a mobile view. Nothing had to be done because according to the article on Altamira, 
Common Screen Sizes for Responsive Web Design, it states "The minimal mobile screen resolution is 320px in width that is suitable 
for iPhone 5SE. For the latest version of smartphones, screen resolution depends on the target audience. So it can be 320, 360,
or 375 in width. For example, it is for iPhone8 or iPhone X."
